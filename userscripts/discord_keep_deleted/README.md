## Keep Deleted Messages

This script appends deleted messages to the bottom of the chat and changes their background color to red.

The deleted messages are visible until you reload the channel or refresh the page.

There is also a bug when scrolling up where messages will be shown as deleted even if they haven't actually been deleted.
